This project is the Palindrome Checker written in java. 
The program is designed to determine whether a given string of text is a palindrome. 
A palindrome can be a word, phrase,sequence of characters, or numbers that reads the same forward and backwards.

Important programming concepts employed with this assignment are control structures such as for loops (for / while loops, if/else statements), data structures such as queue (linked list), and
input handling such as the Scanner class for user input.

Expected inputs and outputs of the application are:

For a palindrome word:
OUTPUT: Please enter a string:
INPUT: kayak
OUTPUT: The string you entered is a palindrome. 
The string you originally entered is kayak
/

For a word that is not a palindrome:
OUTPUT: Please enter a string:
INPUT: palindrome
OUTPUT: The string you entered is not a palindrome. 
The string you originally entered is palindrome
/

For a palindrome phrase:
OUTPUT: Please enter a string:
INPUT: Never odd or even
OUTPUT: The string you entered is a palindrome. 
The string you originally entered is Never odd or even
/

For a phrase that is not a palindrome:
OUTPUT: Please enter a string:
INPUT: Hi i'm paul
OUTPUT: The string you entered is not a palindrome. 
The string you originally entered is Hi i'm paul
/
